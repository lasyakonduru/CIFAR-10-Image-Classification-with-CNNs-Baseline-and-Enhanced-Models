# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## üìñ Project Overview

This project builds and evaluates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for multi-class image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 low-resolution images (32x32x3) across 10 categories: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

Our focus is on creating models that achieve high accuracy and recall, particularly for the "deer" category, to develop AI systems for preventing deer-vehicle collisions. The enhanced model is designed for integration into future AI-powered emergency systems in vehicles.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loaded CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - Normalized image pixel values to [0, 1] for faster training.
   - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical target labels.

### 2. **Baseline Model**
   - **Architecture**:
     - 2 convolutional layers (64 filters each, ReLU activation, max pooling).
     - 1 dense feedforward layer with 120 neurons.
     - Output layer with 10 classes (softmax activation).
   - **Training**: Adam optimizer, learning rate = 0.001, batch size = 32, epochs = 10.
   - **Accuracy**: ~65% on the test set.

### 3. **Enhanced Model**
   - **Architecture**:
     - 3 convolutional layers (128, 64, 32 filters respectively, ReLU activation).
     - MaxPooling and dropout for regularization.
     - 2 dense feedforward layers with 128 and 64 neurons, respectively.
   - **Training**: Similar to baseline with additional dropout for regularization.
   - **Accuracy**: ~67% on the test set.
   - Improved recall for "truck" class.

### 4. **Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix for class-wise accuracy.
   - Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualization of predictions with confidence scores.
